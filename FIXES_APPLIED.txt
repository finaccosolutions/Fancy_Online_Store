FIXES APPLIED - November 30, 2024

1. HERO CAROUSEL IMAGES - Fixed Image Display
   Location: src/pages/Home.tsx (Lines 225, 229)
   Issue: Images showed partial overlap when scrolling
   Fix: Changed object-cover to object-contain and added flex centering
   Result: Each image displays fully in one scroll without overlap

2. EXPLORE COLLECTIONS - Products Display Enhanced
   Location: src/pages/Home.tsx (Lines 563-595)
   Issues Fixed:
   a) Missing MRP (Original Price) - Now shows strikethrough price below current price
   b) Incomplete Star Rating - Now shows all 5 stars with filled/unfilled stars
   c) Hidden Wishlist Icon on Mobile - Removed hover-only opacity, now always visible

3. BUY NOW FUNCTIONALITY - Fixed Navigation Flow
   Location: src/pages/Home.tsx (Lines 160-173)
   Previous: Navigate directly to checkout with buyNow parameter
   Fixed: 
   - Adds product to cart first (preserving existing cart items)
   - Shows success toast with loading message
   - Navigates to cart page (not checkout)
   - Existing cart items remain intact
   Result: User can see all items in cart including buy-now product

All changes tested and built successfully.
